  description: `This is the checkpoint for the creation of a Particle System in Processing. In this checkpoint, 
  a ball is simulated bouncing around in 3D. The ball's movements are computed using Eulerian Numerican Integration.
  Whenever the mouse hits the ball with some velocity, the ball will move according to the direction and magnitude of the hit.`,
